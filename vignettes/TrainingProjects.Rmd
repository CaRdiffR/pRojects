Training projects are projects where you need to produce materials for others and/or to produce slides.

The function `createTrainingProject()` aims to facilitate your training projects by setting up a best practices template project.

## Basic projects
A basic project that's created with `createBasicProject()` is the fundamental building block for this type of project. Read more about [basic projects](BasicProjects.html) to get insight into them.

## Setup
At the moment, this facility will set up a basic project with some additional folders:

- data
- handouts
- slides

## Make your own
You could either make a wrapper around `createTrainingProject()` to add additional setup steps, or you could make an alternative version of the function.

If you make your own, we'd be interested to hear about what you change/add and why. Please let us know on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lockedata/pRojects/issues).

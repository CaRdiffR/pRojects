Training projects are projects where you need to produce materials for others and/or to produce slides.

The function `createTrainingProject()` aims to facilitate your training projects by setting up a best practices template project.

## Basic projects
A basic project that's created with `createBasicProject()` is the fundamental building block for this type of project. Read more about [basic projects](BasicProjects.html) to get insight into them.

## Setup
At the moment, this facility will set up a basic project with some additional folders:

- data
- handouts
- slides

## Document packages
If you make a `handouts/` or `slides` directory (both of which are created with the defaults), we will add rmarkdown to the project's DESCRIPTION file. 

You can specify an alternative package for your handouts via `handoutEngine`. At present, the only other supported package is [`bookdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bookdown). If you select `bookdown` as the `handoutEngine`, `bookdown` will be added to the DESCRIPTION file and the bookdown-demo files will be added to the `handouts/` directory.

You can specify an alternative package for your slides via `slideEngine`. At present, the only other supported package is [`revealjs`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=revealjs). 

If the `packrat` argument is not supplied or is set to `TRUE`, we will update the packrat manifest so that the packages are available when you open the project.

## Make your own
You could either make a wrapper around `createTrainingProject()` to add additional setup steps, or you could make an alternative version of the function.

If you make your own, we'd be interested to hear about what you change/add and why. Please let us know on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lockedata/pRojects/issues).
